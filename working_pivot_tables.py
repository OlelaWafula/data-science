# Pivot temperature by city and year
"""
*It's interesting to see how temperatures for each city change over timeâ€”looking at every month results in a big table, which can be tricky to reason about. Instead, let's look at how temperatures change by year.

*You can access the components of a date (year, month and day) using code of the form dataframe["column"].dt.component. For example, the month component is dataframe["column"].dt.month, and the year component is dataframe["column"].dt.year.

*Once you have the year column, you can create a pivot table with the data aggregated by city and year.

*A pivot table is just a DataFrame with sorted indexes, so the technique  the .loc[] + slicing combination is often helpful.
