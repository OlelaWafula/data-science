# Finding missing values
"""
*Missing values are everywhere, and you don't want them interfering with your work. Some functions ignore missing data by default, but that's not always the behavior you might want. 
*Some functions can't handle missing values at all, so these values need to be taken care of before you can use them. 
*If you don't know where your missing values are, or if they exist, you could make mistakes in your analysis. 
*In this exercise, you'll determine if there are missing values in the dataset, and if so, how many.

# Removing missing values
"""
*Now that you know there are some missing values in your DataFrame, you have a few options to deal with them. 
*One way is to remove them from the dataset completely. 
*In this exercise, you'll remove missing values by removing all rows that contain missing values.
"""
# Remove rows with missing values

# Check if any columns contain missing values

# Replacing missing values
"""
*Another way of handling missing values is to replace them all with the same value. For numerical variables, one option is to replace values with 0 â€” you'll do this here. 
*However, when you replace missing values, you make assumptions about what a missing value means. 
*In this case, you will assume that a missing number sold means that no sales for that avocado type were made that week.

*In this exercise, you'll see how replacing missing values can affect the distribution of a variable using histograms. 
*You can plot histograms for multiple variables at a time as follows:

    dogs[["height_cm", "weight_kg"]].hist()
