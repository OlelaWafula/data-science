# Statistics
"""
*Statistics - practice and study of collecting and analyzing data.
*Summary statistics - a fact about or summary of some data. e.g, average or count

# What can statistics do? Answers quiz such as:

    -How likely is someone to purchase a product? Are people more likely to purchase it if they can use a different payment system?
    -How many occupants will your hotel have? How can you optimize occupancy?
    -How many sizes of jeans needs to be manufactured so they can fit 95% of the population? Should the same number of each size be produced?
    -A/B tests: Which ad is more effective in getting people to purchase a product?

# What statistics can't do? quiz such as:

    -Why is Game of Thrones so popular?
    Instead we can find out whether series with more violent scenes are viewed by more people. But even if they do, this can't tell us if more violent scenes lead to more views.
